# 2048 for World of Warcraft
#### Play while you wait to play!


2048 is a port of [Gabriele Cirulli's 2048 game](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/). Based on 1024 by Veewo Studio and conceptually similar to Threes by Asher Vollmer.

The idea came while I was waiting for a LFR group to come up. I was playing 2048 on my tablet and suddently thought "hey, wouldn't it be great if I had a 2048 game inside WoW?". And so there it is.


## Instructions
Nothing fancy here, juste type `/2048` to show the game or click on the 2048 icon if you use a LDB display such as ChocolateBar or Bazooka.

Click the arrow buttons to move the tiles. You may also use your keyboard if the option is checked in the control panel. <u>Be aware though that the keyboard will only work when the mouse cursor is over the game's frame</u>.

Keys: `Left`, `Right`, `Up` and `Down` arrows to move the tiles, `Esc` to close the game.

## Changelog

Enjoy!

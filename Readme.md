## This is a beta version. It still needs extended testing and feedback before it goes to release.

# 2048 for World of Warcraft
#### Play while you wait to play!####


2048 is a port of [Gabriele Cirulli's 2048 game](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/). Based on 1024 by Veewo Studio and conceptually similar to Threes by Asher Vollmer.

The idea came while I was waiting for a LFR group to come up. I was playing 2048 on my tablet and suddently thought "hey, wouldn't it be great if I had a 2048 game inside WoW?". And so there it is.

## Instructions
Nothing fancy here, juste type `/2048` to show the game or click on the 2048 icon if you use a LDB display such as ChocolateBar or Bazooka.

Use the arrow buttons to move the tiles. You may also use your keyboard if the option is checked in the control panel. Be aware though that the keyboard will only work when the mouse cursor is over the game's frame.

**NB:** since 2048 is still in beta stage, it is disabled by default! You must specifically enable it in the AddOn Manager before you can play.

**NB2:** I'am aware that 2048 suffers from some animation glitches since Legion. I'll work on it when I have time.


## TODO:
* **Better animation**. Blizzard API is really not intended for such things so I even don't know if this is possible at all.
* **Testing**, testing and testing. Thank to anyone who can provide feedback either on [Curse.com](http://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/wow2048) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/Septh/WoW-2048)

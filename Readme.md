# 2048 for World of Warcraft

**Play while you wait to play!**

2048 for WoW is a port of [Gabriele Cirulli's 2048 game](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/).

The idea came while I was waiting for a LFR group to come up. I was playing 2048 on my tablet and suddently thought "hey, wouldn't it be great if I had a 2048 game *inside* WoW?". And so there it is.


## Instructions

Nothing fancy here, juste type `/2048` to show/hide the game or click the 2048 icon if you use a LibDataBroker (LDB) display such as [ChocolateBar](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/chocolatebar) (my favorite) or [Bazooka](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/bazooka).

Click the arrow buttons to move the tiles. You may also use your keyboard if the option is checked in the control panel. Be aware though that the keyboard will only work when the mouse cursor is over the game's frame.

Keys: `Left`, `Right`, `Up` and `Down` arrows to move the tiles, `Enter` to restart the curren game, `Esc` to hide the game's frame.


## Need help?

I rarely read comments here on Curse.com; should you need any help, you'd better open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Septh/WoW-2048 "GitHub repository"), where the projet lives.


## Licence

2048 for WoW is released under the [MIT licence](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
